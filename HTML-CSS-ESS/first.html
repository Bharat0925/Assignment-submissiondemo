    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious 
    disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to 
    moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, 
    some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

<pre>
   * Maintain a safe distance from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.
   * Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
   * Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
   * Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
   * Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.

    Everyone 18 and older is eligible to get the vaccine 
    against Covid-19. Availability may vary by state.
    The COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States are 
    highly effective at preventing severe disease and death, 
    including against the Delta variant. But they are not 100% 
    effective and some fully vaccinated people will become
    infected (called a breakthrough infection) and experience illness.
